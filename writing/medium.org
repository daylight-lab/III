* Introduction

# ** Introduce 'the splinternet'
According to TechCrunch, [[https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/the-splinternet-is-already-here/][the "splinternet" is already here]].

According to Forbes, [[https://fortune.com/2019/05/29/splinternet-online-censorship/][it's growing]].

Governments, firms, and citizen/users/customers are in 2019 again debating to
what extent the Internet is, and/or should be, a global infrastructure for
communication and commerce. In these debates, the Internet is supposedly
becoming increasingly fragmented.

Both extremes---a global Internet on one hand, and a nationalized "splinternet"
on the other---are cartoons of what has always been a mixed reality. The digital
world never has floated freely, untethered from political and geographical
boundaries, nor has it has ever been fully under the political control of
particular countries.

Nevertheless, the question of how the Internet varies between national
boundaries is a pressing one. Understanding the Internet's character in
different countries is a key concern to policymakers, advocacy groups, and
decisionmakers in industry.


# ** The problem

However, these debates are currently carried out on the basis of anecdotes and
impressionistic assessments, not standardized and replicable metrics that can
measure change over time.

Those metrics that do exist, such as the Freedom House Freedom on the Net index
[2] or the New America Foundation’s Digital Deciders [1], which place the
political value of “freedom” or “openness” at the center of their indices,
implicitly assuming that a less nationalized Internet is a more free Internet.
However, current moves by Russia and China question the assumption that a global
Internet architecture will by necessity impose Western conceptions of freedom. A
global Internet could just as easily become globally censored.[fn:8]

** Introducing the Internet Locality Dataset

This project aims to bring some measurement to this debate. Rather than building
value judgements into our metrics, we aim to measure the underlying architecture
of the Internet, without building in assumptions about desired outcomes. We seek
to enable normative discussions about what values to maximize, and descriptive
discussions about how best to navigate a (potentially) fragmented world.

We built a dataset to measure Internet fragmentation through proxy measures on
four different layers of the Internet "stack." For this cursory step, we
collected proxy measures for the year 2019. With this dataset, we produced
``profiles'' of different countries' Internets.

*You can find all of our code, data and analysis [[https://github.com/daylight-lab/III][on Github]]*. 

In this post, we describe what proxies we collected, and some immediate findings.
At a high-level. We find that the Internet is not bipolar between ``free'' and
``closed.'' In fact, the Internet is multipolar; some ``free'' countries (such
as Germany and the United States), as well as some ``closed'' countries (such as
China and Saudi Arabia) have meaningfully different profiles from one another.
In addition, some ``free'' countries have surprisingly /similar/ profiles to
some ``closed'' countries.

# We also suggest some future work and possible extensions. 
# Our goal is to make this data actionable for policymakers, industry decision-makers and academics.

* Measuring the Internet

| Layer              | Number  | Our proxy                   |
|--------------------+---------+-----------------------------|
| Legal/social/human | Layer 5 | Data laws          |
| Application        | Layer 4 | Website ranking locality    |
| Transport          | Layer 3 | Network interference events |
| Network            | Layer 2 | IPv4/IPv6 transition        |
| Link               | Layer 1 |                             |
#+CAPTION: The TCP/IP "stack" model of the Internet, matched with the proxies we use to measure fragmentation on that layer.

"Layer models" describe the Internet's composition using hierarchical concepts,
each defined by their function. Each layer sits "on top" of the layer beneath
it, with the more abstracted layers sitting at the top of the stack.

We collected one proxy measuring fragmentation at each layer of this stack, with
each proxy measure spanning all of 2019. Our goal was to achieve a snapshot of
fragmentation as of 2019, one we can compare in the future.

You can find all of our code, data and analysis [[https://github.com/daylight-lab/III][on Github]]. We'll briefly go over
each layer, and the proxy we use to measure it.

** Layer 5: Data laws

/"Layer 5" (legal/social/human). The "fifth layer" refers to human activity (e.g., laws and politics)./

As a proxy of fragmentation on the human layer, we measured the degree to which
countries have laws regulating the flow, storage or production of data. 

We found [[https://github.com/daylight-lab/III/tree/master/data-locality-laws][data-related laws in 66 countries]]. We coded these laws across 42
different categories, ranging from data locality laws, to restrictions on
cross-border data flow, to regulations around the use of encryption. For each
country, we tailed whether or not the country had a law in any of the partiuclar
categories, producing a score for each country ranging from 0 to 42.

** Layer 4: Website ranking locality

/Application layer. Standardizes communications across transport layer to create specific-purpose functionality. Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) is a familiar example
of application-layer software./

To measure application layer fragmentation, we looked at the most popular
websites in every given country, and determined how simliar or different these
rankings were from the global total. While factors such as language and culture
certainly produce meaningful differences here, we assume these factors will
remain stable over time; as such, divergences in this metric over time should
reveal fragmentation stemming from, for example, censorship.

To compute this metric, we use the [[https://www.alexa.com/topsites][Alexa rankings]] to determine the 50 most
popular websites in every country (by traffic). We use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance][Levenshtein distance]] to
compute the edit distance between each country's list and the global list. This
leaves us with a metric expressing how much each country's web browsing habits
differs from the global rankings. [fn:5]

** Layer 3: Network interference events

/Transport layer. Abstract network and link layers to provide appearance of
persistent connections./

To measure transport layer (layer 3) fragmentation, we use data collected by the
[[https://ooni.org/][Open Observatory of Network Interference]] (OONI)[fn:6]. OONI requires volunteers
to install a plugin, which periodically performs tests to measure circumvention
on the transport layer. These include mostly state-launched attacks (such as DNS
manipulation or traffic filtering), but may also include private-sector
manipulation, such as throttling streaming traffic.[fn:4]

** Layer 2: IPv6 adoption

/Network layer. Transfers data between networks. The IP protocols (either v4 or
v6) manage this transfer./

You may be familiar with the notion of an "IP address," a unique locator that
identifies every machine on the Internet. For decades, we used IPv4 addresses
(e.g., 192.168.1.1). However, the proliferation of Internet-connected devices
has put pressure on our address space, and the Internet is now running low on
IPv4 addresses. A new standard, IPv6, is slowly being rolled out, but this
roll-out has been uneven across national borders.

As a proxy for interlink layer (layer 2) fragmentation, we use [[https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption][Google's
per-country IPv6 adoption statistics]], which Google collects from all Google
services and analytics users.[fn:1]  


** Layer 1: No proxy

/Link layer. Transfers data within a local network./

You might have noticed that we did not pick a proxy for the link layer (layer
1). In practice, the entire world uses the Ethernet protocol for their link
layer, at least as far as we are aware. In the absence of compelling data about
fragmentation on this layer, we excluded it from our model.

* TODO Visualizing our data

To understand our data, we produce a "radar" (or "spiderweb") plot. The radar
plot describes a given country's spread across the four metrics we currently
measure. By visually comparing these radar plots, we can establish rough
"profiles" for countries.

# MAYBE CHINA VS US IS MORE OBVIOUS HERE

[[./figures/scandinavians.png]]

Here's an example. It compares the Scandinavian countries to one another. This
chart shows us that Norway has a higher rate of network interference than its
neighbors, while Sweden has a higher level of content-layer locality. All
countries have roughly the same level of legal-layer locality.

# MAYBE FIVE EYES VS CHINA IS MORE OBVIOUS HERE

[[./figures/three-bloc.png]]

We can also average multiple countries' metrics together to create /blocks/.
Here's an example comparing Five Eyes countries[fn:3], Belt & Road countries,
and Islamic theocracies[fn:7] . Overall, Belt & Road countries have the same
rate of network interference, which is surprising. However, Belt & Road
countries[fn:2] have higher content-layer locality, and more data regulations.
Interestingly, it is the Islamic theocracies who have the highest incidence of
network interference, though they, overall, have no laws regulating data.

* What we found

** The Internet is not bi-polar

[[./figures/us-cn-bh-de.png]]


*The Internet is multi-polar, with different Internet governance decisions
producing diverse types of fragmentation.*
It's tempting to imagine a bi-polar Internet, with China on one side, and the
West on the other. In this model, it would be tempting to place, for example,
Bahrain on the China ``side.'' Germany might sit on the ``US side.'' Our metrics
reveal a much more complex picture. /In fact, all four countries mentioned here
have different profiles to one another/.
** Surprising divergences
*Countires you would expect to be similar are sometimes quite different*. 
Take China and its Belt & Road partners [fn:2]. Per popular
imagination, China's model of the Internet has set a precedent, one which other
Belt and Road countries follow.

[[./figures/china-vs-belt-and-road.png]]

Our data challenges that assumption. In fact, China stands out from other Belt &
Road countries. It has more data locality laws, a high degree of website
locality (perhaps as a result of censorship[fn:4]), and significantly higher
network interference. In fact, China's only similarity with other Belt & Road
countries are its low rates of IPv6 adoption.

[[./figures/in-bd.png]]

Alternatively, consider India and Bangladesh. Despite similar culture, history,
and geographic locality, these two regional neighbors have substantially
different profiles.

** Unexpected similarities
[[./figures/no-vs-islamic.png]]

*Countries you would expect to be different can be surprisingly similar*. If you
asked me what Norway has in common with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, etc, I'd have
said "aside from oil, not much."

In reality, these countires have similar amounts of network interference, a
similar degree of content-layer locality, and similar IPv6 penetration. The main
difference that our profiles captures is simply that these Gulf states tend not
to have laws restricting the flow of data.
* What now?
Our profiles allow us to view 'internet fragmentation' in a more nuanced way.
Through this view, policymakers and advocates can describe how /specifically/
the internet differs across national borders.

*These specific metrics could help policymakers, advocacy organizations and
academics work toward specific, data-driven goals*. In doing so, they stand a
chance at de-fragmenting the Internet in a targeted way.

*Our data could provide industry stakeholders with a roadmap for moving from one
market to another*. For example, if a technology company is thinking of moving
from the United States to Southeast Asia, they could use our data to select
those countries with which the United States has a similar Internet.

Finally, as we collect this data year after year, we could measure the *velocity
and direction of fragmentation over time*. Is the Internet becoming more
fragmented overall? Are new clusters emerging? Are existing clusters merging
into larger clusters? How quickly? How decisively?

** Future work: Clusters of interoperability
<<future-work>>

While our current work compares countries on a global scale,
future work could create point-to-point comparisons of countries,
producing *clusters of Internets
that are interoperable with one another*.

For example, on our content layer, we currently look at how similar popular
websites are to a global average. 
- But how similar is Argentina's list of most popular websites compared to Chile's? 
- How similar are the /types/ of network interference in Argentina vs Chile? 
- Both countries may have data laws, but do they have the /same/ or /similar/ data laws?

With this tool, policymakers could create more targeted interventions to, for
example "join the five-eyes Internet" or "move away from the Belt & Road
internet."

Those in industry could use these clusters as a key strategic planning tool,
allowing them to move products across Internets that, despite superficial
differences, are actually quite interoperable.

** Future work: The physical layer
The Internet is fundamentally a physical infrastructure, built out of
heterogeneous edge devices, switchboards, cables and radio waves. In the future,
we hope to look toward the add the lower, physical layer of the Internet to our
model, analyzing (for example) [[https://www.wired.com/2015/11/security-news-this-week-bay-area-fiber-optic-cables-mysteriously-cut/][cable-cutting incidents]], heterogeneous devices or
tools among switchboard or other infrastructure operators, and perhaps even
fragmented devices on the edges of the Internet (such as penetration of personal
computers, cellphones, tablets, etc). Fragmentation on the physical layer fills
a potentially missing component of our Internet fragmentation story.

a political value of ``freedom,'' but overall higher ``freedom'' on average if
most countries, or a few large countries, become significantly more open.

where Google is blocked. However, Google's statistic [[http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-03/14/c_137895292.htm][roughly matches the one
