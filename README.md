## Running the notebooks

In the main repo directory, run a jupyter notebook.

```
cd III/
jupyter notebook
```

Each subfolder is responsible for computing particular metrics. Refer to each folder's README for details.

# Todos

- Find a way to occasionally update shared data.

# Ideas

- Metrics can grab data asynchronously; new indices are lazily evaluated & cached.
