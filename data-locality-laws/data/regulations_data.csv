Section 310(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 states that a foreign government or representative may not directly hold a spectrum license. 

Section 310(b)(1) and (2) state that foreign individuals and business entities may not directly hold any common carrier, broadcast or aeronautical fixed on en route licenses.

The Federal Communications Commission has the discretion to allow foreign ownership in excess of 25% unless such ownership is inconsistent with the public interest.

Furthermore, CFIUS can block an acquisition based on national security considerations. An instance of this is the failed acquisition of MoneyGram by the Chinese Ant Financial.

The review of the Committee on Foreign Investment on National Security considerations applies to controlling investments in US businesses (it does not apply to Greenfield investments). Additionally, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) seeks to identify and address any national security risk that arises as a result of a covered transaction and can request that the President determines whether to suspend or prohibit a covered transaction or take other action. 

The list of factors for consideration by CFIUS are: 
- potential effects of the transaction on the domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements;
- potential effects of the transaction on the capability and capacity of domestic industries to meet national defense requirements; 
- potential effects of the transaction on U.S. international technological leadership in areas affecting U.S. national security;
- potential national security related effects on U.S. critical technologies;
- potential national security related effects of the transaction on U.S. critical infrastructure, among others. 

Acquisitions blocked or delayed by CFIUS on national security grounds include the following cases: 
1. In 2008, Bain Capital and Huawei Technologies withdrew their offer to acquire the network and software firm 3Com, due to the inability to successfully negotiate a mitigation agreement with CFIUS members.
2. The acquisition of Sprint Nextel by the Japanese firm SoftBank was opposed to, given the former relied on Huawei for equipment and cell tower base stations. SoftBank agreed to remove Huawei as a supplier when the acquisition was completed. 
3. In 2011, some Members of the US Congress requested the Obama Administration to support a recommendation by CFIUS to block a proposed acquisition of 3Leaf Systems by Huawei Technologies over national security concerns. Given this backdrop, Huawei discontinued its efforts to acquire the firm.
4. in 2018, following a review by the CFIUS, President Trump signed an order blocking the acquisition of Broadcom by Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.
5. Following recommendation from CFIUS, the President of the US blocked the USD 1.3bn acquisition of Lattice. a US semiconductor company, by investors including a state-backed Chinese investment fund on grounds of national security.

Defending U.S. Government Communications Act (proposal)","Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE, other Chinese network equipment","In October 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), a congressional panel, recommended against the purchase of equipment manufactured by Huawei by US telecommunications firms. According to the HPSCI, there was ""insufficient evidence"" to disprove the assertation that Huawei equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on US networks, and that government systems, particularly sensitive systems, should therefore not include Huawei equipment, including component parts of such equipment. The HPSCI report also stated that US network providers and systems developers were strongly encouraged to seek other vendors for their projects, and that American firms currently using these products  should divest in the interest of their customers and their country. 

In 2013, following this report, the US House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill prohibiting the purchase of telecom equipment produced by Chinese state-owned or state-directed companies, like Huawei, by the Commerce and Justice Departments, the National Science Foundation and NASA. This departments are prohibited from acquiring information technology systems ""produced, manufactured or assembled by entities owned, directed or subsidized by the Chinese government"", unless the purchasing agency consults with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and also determines that the purchase is in the interests of the USA. Other firms which face this ban include Lenovo and ZTE.

Additionally, in January 2018, a bill termed the ""Defending U.S. Government Communications Act"" was proposed which would prohibit the US government in its entirety from purchasing “telecommunications equipment and/or services,” from Huawei and ZTE.",,2018,"Since March 2013

Regulation 2017 sets out a number of changes including advancing the participation of small and black-owned businesses by changing prequalification criteria in the bidding process of public procurement tenders and in doing so limiting the participation of ""well-established companies""; tenders worth more than R 30 million (USD 2.21 million) must impose a ""specific tendering condition that the successful tenderer must subcontract a minimum of 30% of the value of the contract"" to small and black-owned businesses; and changing the point system which determines the awarding of tenders in public procurement to favour B-BBEE status level of contributors - B-BBEE status level is determined from the participation of black people at a company in specific function and roles.",,2017,Since May 2017,http://www.globaltradealert.org/intervention/57160,,,

It is reported that Russian data protection laws have been enforced quite heavily in recent years and data subjects have sent many complaints to Roskomnadzor. 

There has also been a growing number of appeals by data operators against the orders and decisions of Roskomnadzor imposing different sanctions on data operators and blocking their Internet resources.

As of 2017, Russia diversified how it fines breaches of data processing legislation, and increased overall fines. Now, illegal data processing can be fined between RUB 15,000 (approx. USD 260) and RUB 70,000 (approx. USD 1,230).

Additionally,  Law No. 374 amends the Code of Administrative Violations to establish fines of up to RUB40,000 (approx. USD 700) for encryption which goes beyond mandated levels and for the use of previously uncertified encryption equipment. Furthermore, the Law imposes on distributors of information via the Internet the obligation to report to the Federal Security Service “all information required for the description of received, transferred, or delivered electronic communications.” The refusal to provide such information will be punishable by a fine in the amount of RUB 1,000,000 (approx.

There is no registration threshold. Therefore, all foreign businesses that sell digital products to Russia-based consumers must collect VAT and report to Russian tax authorities. In effect, this means that a VAT of up to 18% is charged on online purchases in Russia.

The VAT regime for e-services will apply along with the VAT exemption for licensing of software and databases. Absent of any clear distinction between ""software as a service"" and software as an IP right, using this exemption for e-services would likely lead to disputes with tax authorities.

India’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology formally established a “Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance” on November 2010. The policy was intended to serve as a framework for selecting standards for the hardware and software underlying e-Governance systems within India.

Another distinguishing feature of the policy is the requirement for a “single” standard for each technology domain, which also provides for exceptions allowing for multiple standards in a technology area if technically justified or in the public interest.

In addition to the intellectual property rights requirements, the policy identifies other mandatory characteristics for a standard adopted in e-Governance infrastructures. The documentation of the standard should be available for free or for a nominal fee. The standard should be maintained by a non-profit organization with an open and participatory development process. The policy also specifies that the standard should be a technology-neutral specification. The term “technology neutral” is explained as platform independence, with platform defined as an operating system, type of hardware, or transmission device. The final mandatory characteristic for a standard to be considered open is that it should enable local support, including being accessible in all Indian official languages.",,2010,Since November 2010,http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_072179.pdf,,,

Electronic Commerce Regulations",Internet intermediaries,"The Directive 2000/31/EC (E-Commerce Directive) is the legal basis governing the liability of Internet Services Providers (ISPs) in the EU Member States and includes a conditional safe harbor. The Directive covers any type of infringement of third-party rights, including intellectual and industrial property rights and personality rights. 

The limitations on liability in the Directive apply to clearly delimited activities (mere conduit, caching and hosting) carried out by internet intermediaries, rather than to categories of service providers or types of information.

In Spain, Article 13 has been implemented via two requirements:
- Video-on-demand (VOD) providers are obliged to reserve a share of European works in their catalogue. 
- VOD players are required to contribute financially to the production and rights acquisition of European works.

The implementation was considered by several media experts and media outlets as too strict. 

The main problem is the unclear definition as to which online services can be subject to the regulation. The main criteria for the inclusion of on-demand services (OVD) are that they are provided on a commercial basis (e.g. there is advertising on the website) and they are organized in a catalog, which can refer to any website section containing videos of the respective media outlet.

RVR can impose fines if it finds that video content does not comply with standards for child protection, depiction of violence, hate speech, profanity, etc. Online video also has to contain information about the minimum recommended age for viewers. 

RVR used the law’s provisions for the first time in April 2011 when it warned Mac TV for a broadcast titled “Academia destructiva–Televízor” that was aired on its website (Huste.tv). RVR reasoned that Mac TV had violated the provision on protection of minors by restricting the broadcast for the lowest-age category of viewers under 15, because it believed that the broadcast should have been restricted for minors under 18 as it contained a large amount of profanities.",,2011,Since 2011,http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/mapping-digital-media-slovakia-20130702.pdf,,,

According to the AVMS Directive on-demand services are not subject to any explicit, strict content quota, but Article 13 imposes on Member States the obligation to ensure that on-demand service providers promote European works. The Directive has been implemented by Member States in different ways, ranging from very extensive and detailed measures to a mere reference to the general obligation to promote European works.

In France, Article 13 is implemented via three channels:
- Video on Demand (VOD) service providers should feature at least 60% of European works and 40% of French-speaking works (some of which may come from non-EU territories such as Canada). 
- Financial contributions to the production or rights acquisition of European work are required. Since 2011, French subscription video-on-demand providers with a turnover exceeding 10 million euro must invest up to 26% of their annual revenues in European films and up to 22% of these revenues in French-speaking productions.
- The use of tools which give prominence to European works is required such as displaying a substantial proportion of European or French-speaking works on the home/front page. This should be achieved not only by mentioning the title, but also by showing visuals and trailers.",,2014,Reported in 2014,"Press release -Video on Demand and the Promotion of European Works -European Audiovisual Observatory publishes new IRIS Special Report

Although the act requires its implementation no later than six months after its promulgation, on January 2017, the French government’s initial Article 30 implementing decree was rejected by the State Council, France’s highest administrative court, on the grounds that the article’s remuneration mechanism did not conform to EU legislation.

This means that foreign companies need to offer a payment method with Dankort in order to penetrate the market.

The Directive has been implemented by Member States in different ways, ranging from very extensive and detailed measures to a mere reference to the general obligation to promote European works.

In Belgium, the Directive has been implemented via three obligations:
- The Belgian CSA Recommendation on the promotion of European works - applicable in the French Community of Belgium – does not impose specific shares of European works in the catalogue, but the recommendations consider aspects such as the presence of a substantial offer of European works, the composition of thematic catalogues etc. 

- The promotion of European works in the catalogues should be ensured by using all promotion techniques possible, e.g. advertising inserts and other publicity measures in the electronic programme guide or on the website, a specific section dedicated to European works, etc. 

- Video-on-demand service providers have to contribute financially to the production and rights acquisition of European works.

Neither protection applied since it was Google's own behaviour that was in question, not the content of sites to which it permitted access.

The limitations on liability in the Directive apply to clearly delimited activities (mere conduit, caching and hosting) carried out by internet intermediaries, rather than to categories of service providers or types of information. While it was not considered necessary to cover hyperlinks and search engines in the Directive, the Commission has encouraged Member States to further develop legal security for Internet intermediaries. 

Since not all Member States have transposed the relevant articles consistently, the national case law is divergent and leads to legal insecurity on an EU level.

Statement regarding Investment by Foreign State Owned Enterprises","Accelero Capital Holdings Inc., Lenovo","There are several cases reported in which investment in Canada's telecom sector was blocked based on national security reasons. In 2013, the intended acquisition of the Canadian firm Manitoba Telecom Services’ Allstream Division by Accelero Capital Holding (from Egypt) was blocked on national security grounds. The legal basis was the national security review of investment regulations from 2009, which allows the Canadian government to block investments in strategic areas of the economy. 

In another earlier case, VimpelCom Ltd., which is controlled by a Russian firm, withdrew a request to acquire a controlling interest in the Canadian new entrant wireless carrier, Wind Mobile. The reasons were also national security concerns expressed by the Canadian government. In the same year, a second acquisition was rejected by the Canadian authorities. It involved Lenovo Group Ldt. and Blackberry Ltd. The Canadian government opposed this transaction due to BlackBerry's ties into Canada's telecom infrastructure. 

Additionally, the Canadian government has established new rules restricting and monitoring investments by foreign state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Canada, which indicate concerns about the prospects of foreign nationalization.

However, the draft Law contains no detail on any review procedures, as well as on any objective criteria to establish whether a specific product or service is fit for use in critical systems. The definition of ""Critical System"" also remains unclear, including whether this term covers state-owned systems only or also private systems.

The draft Law introduced the concept of ""cybersecurity assurance services"" (CAS), which partially overlaps with the concept of cyber information security services under Article 41 of the Law on Cyber Information Security (LOCIS) (for more information on LOCIS, see entry in Chapter 11 on Quantitative Trade Restrictions). CAS includes cybersecurity services relating to audit, assessment, consultancy, supervision, prevention, and testing. A license from the Ministry of Public Security is required for the business of providing CAS. The draft Law further states that this law will prevail in cases of overlap with the LOCIS.

On 28 May 2010, MOIT published Circular 24/2010/TT-BCT, which requires local importers to obtain an automatic import license from the government before any shipment can be unloaded at any Vietnamese port.
On 5 September 2011, MOIT issued Circular 32/2011/TT-BCT to amend the Circular 24/2010/TT-BCT. This Circular entered into force on 20 October 2011. The biggest revision under the new circular is that all 22 commodities mentioned in Annex 1 of Circular 24/2010/TT-BCT are now subject to automatic import licensing. There are only two exceptions, wire telephone sets (HS code 8517.11.00.00) and mobile phones (HS code: 8517.12.00.00). These are not subject to this automatic licensing regime.
So far, no complaints have been made in this regard, as the registration procedure by the MOIT is swift. However, once issued, the license is valid only for 30 days, which makes it difficult for companies to calculate when to introduce the request so that it will not expire before the goods arrive at port. The measure may therefore result in backlogs of products at ports, additional business costs and reduced availability of goods.

In addition, an industry analysis published by MIIT suggests that burdensome and invasive testing procedures threatening companies’ sensitive intellectual property could be required. 

Although a globally accepted standard (3GPP) already exists, ZUC is de facto often required in order to enter the Chinese market, along with invasive testing requirements (source code review). These requirements are potentially violating bilateral commitments with the US and a commitment that China made to its trading partners in 2000 stating that China would permit the use of foreign encryption standards in IT and telecommunication hardware and software for commercial use and that it would only impose strict “Chinese-only” encryption requirements on specialized IT products whose “core function” is encryption.",,2012,In 2012,https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2015-Section-1377-Report_FINAL.pdf,,,

Moreover, all testing for the CCC mark must be conducted in China and US exporters are often required to submit their products to Chinese laboratories for additional tests.

The hosting defense in Art. 22 only applies to service providers who host third party materials. Yes, Art. 36 of the Tort Law of the People's Republic of China states that a ""network service provider"" shall assume the tort liability if it infringes on ""upon the civil right or interest of another person."" Furthermore, the Tort Law allows that victims of the tort can notify the network service provider to demand the deletion, blocking or disconnection of the cause of infringement. Failing to do so can lead to further liability for the network provider in the event of further harm to the user. Finally, liability can be further increased in the event that the network service provider knew of the infringement but did not take action.

According to the Chinese criminal code, the founder or directly responsible manager of a website, knowing that any other person is producing, reproducing, publishing, selling or disseminating pornographic electronic information, allows or connives at the person’s publishing such information on the website. Therefore, the founder or directly responsible manager shall be convicted of the crime of disseminating pornographic items for profits.

In May 2014, the Chinese government revoked the Internet business license of Shenzhen QVOD Technology Inc, a Chinese online peer-to-peer video-hosting platform and forced it to shut down all the servers due to copyright infringement and Internet pornography. QVOD was later fined 260 million yuan ($40 million). In September 2016, a trial involving four executives of QVOD ended with them being handed sentences of up to 3.5 years.

Draft Measures for the Security Assessment of Outbound Transmission of Personal Information and Critical Data

Information Technology – Personal Information Security Specification (GB/T 35273-2017)",Horizontal,"The Cybersecurity Law includes requirements for personal information of Chinese citizens and “important data” collected by ""key information infrastructure operators"" (KIIOs) to be kept within the borders of China (Art. 37). If transfers of data offshore are necessary for operational reasons, a security assessment must be conducted by designated agencies, unless otherwise regulated by laws and regulations. The definition of KIIOs remains to be finalised. As a result, it is reported that in February 2018, Apple began hosting Chinese users's iCloud accounts, along with their encryption keys, on a Chinese data center so as to comply with these new measures.

Additionally, the Draft Measures for the Security Assessment of Outbound Transmission of Personal Information and Critical Data, issued in April 2017 by the Cyberspace Administration of China, would expand this restriction to all ""network operators"". This expands the scope of the measure to cover most, if not all, cloud service providers. The draft measures allow some smaller organizations (or smaller transfers) to be subject to a simple self-assessment regime, as long as the data they seek to transfer is not deemed relevant to national security, or social and public interest. However, larger organizations and larger transfers (e.g., over 500,000 records) must be assessed by the competent authority.

Additionally, a Personal Information Security Specification, which came into force in May 2018, further cements the need for security assessments when outsourcing data processing to a third party, and mandates the need for audits and contractually obligated security measures. The Specification is not a legally binding text, but the Chinese government agencies are likely to refer to it as a standard to determine whether companies are following China’s data protection rules.",Yes,2018,"Since June 2017

These guidelines instruct the Brazilian government, for example, to prioritize solutions, programs and services based on OSS that promote the optimization of resources and investments in information technology (IT), to adopt open standards and to increase OSS use in the public and private sectors. Furthermore, the Brazilian government is asked to expand the amount of services provided to citizens through OSS, to restrict the growth of software based on proprietary technology, to prioritize the acquisition of compatible hardware platforms for OSS and to strengthen the existing sharing of OSS inside and outside government. Other actions included in the guidelines aim to encourage and promote the domestic market to adopt new business models in IT and communications based on OSS and to create a national policy for OSS.

From these guidelines, several actions were undertaken by the Brazilian government to achieve these goals.

EUROPEAN UNION,Intellectual Property Rights,Patents,Establishment restrictions,EU Patent System,Horizontal,"Patent protection in Europe has traditionally been obtained either through the national patent offices of the Member States or the European Patent Office (EPO) that grants a European patent. Once it is granted and published, however, the patent must first be validated in every State in which the patentee seeks protection. 

Therefore, obtaining a European patent can be extremely costly. When protecting important local markets in Europe, the costs can easily exceed 30,000 € (approx. USD 33,000). In case of large patent families, the costs can even rise up to 100,000 € (approx. USD 110,000) and beyond. 

Although patent filing costs have decreased in the EU, patent filing and maintenance fees in the EU and its Member States remain significantly higher than in other countries, including the United States. For patent renewal, annual fees have to be paid to national offices which sum up to 5,000-15,000 € each. 

The recent creation of a unified system of patent's granting and enforcement in the EU, which has been approved in 2013, is an attempt to resolve the situation. The Unitary Patent (UP) provides a single pan-European patent as a third option for companies or investors seeking patent protection in Europe, ensuring uniform protection in 26 Member States (Croatia and Spain have opted out over language issues, while Italy became a participant in September 2015). The system also includes a litigation system within a Unified Patent Court (Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Poland and Spain have opted out).",,2012,Since 2012,http://www.patent-pilot.com/en/obtaining-a-patent/costs-of-obtaining-a-patent/,https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/European%20Union_0.pdf,http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/intellectual-property/patents/unitary-patent/index_en.htm,

EUROPEAN UNION,Taxation &amp; Subsidies,Discriminatory tax regime on online services,Fiscal Restrictions,Proposal for a Council Directive on the Common System of a Digital Services Tax on Revenues resulting from the Provision of Certain Digital Services,Digital services,"In March 2018, a ""digital services tax"" (DST) was proposed, which would see a 3% rate be applied to digital services companies firms operating in the EU with annual global revenues of €750 million or more, as well as total taxable revenues of 50 million Euros generated across the bloc. The threshold is set to capture some 150 companies, half of which are based in the United States, while a third could be EU firms.

This framework could result in double-taxation of these companies as usually corporate taxes are only paid where the company is incorporated.",,2018,Reported in March 2018,https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/proposal_common_system_digital_services_tax_21032018_en.pdf,,,

These include, inter alia:
- images or text, such as photos, screensavers, e-books and other digitised documents e.g. PDF files; 
- music, films and games, including games of chance and gambling games, and of programmes on demand; 
- online magazines website supply or web hosting services distance maintenance of programmes and equipment; 
- supplies of software and software updates advertising space on a website.

Both EU and non-EU suppliers have to register for VAT purposes and comply with the relevant obligations of the Member State where the customer is established, has his/her permanent address or usually resides. This may be burdensome as there are 81 VAT rates across the 28 EU countries and the rates may vary between 3% (Luxembourg) to 27% (Hungary) across member states. Furthermore, member states impose varying thresholds at which companies must begin paying VAT, ranging from EUR 0 to EUR 60,000.

As an alternative to obtaining multiple VAT registrations in each Member State where a supplier has a customer, affected suppliers may be able to opt to account for VAT across the EU via a a web-portal in the Member State in which they are identified. Hence, the system, known as the Mini One-Stop Shop (MOSS) scheme, allows taxable persons to avoid registering in each Member State of consumption.",,2015,Since January 2015,"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/telecom/one-stop-shop-guidelines_en.pdf

EUROPEAN UNION,Taxation &amp; Subsidies,Discriminatory tax regime on digital goods and products,Fiscal Restrictions,"Directive 2006/112 (EU VAT Directive)

Judgments in Cases C-479/13 and C-502/13 - Commission v France and Commission v Luxembourg",E-books,"The taxation of e-books is partly regulated in the EU VAT Directive. The Directive provides for the possibility for EU States to apply lower rates in favour of paper books. This possibility, however, is not applicable to e-books. As a result, VAT rates for paper books are lower than those for e-books.This difference of treatment is motivated by the nature of the transaction involved in buying a paper book (a tangible good) and an e-book (service licence). 

This distinction was recently confirmed by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) which held that France and Luxembourg had breached the VAT Directive imposing reduced rates with regards to e-books. In its judgment, the ECJ ruled that e-books should not be taxed at reduced rates applicable to paper books (3% VAT) because e-books must be considered an electronically supplied service (17% VAT).",,2006,Since 2006,http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:347:0001:0118:en:PDF,http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-03/cp150030en.pdf,,
