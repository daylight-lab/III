* The Internet is not bi-polar


[[./figures/us-cn-bh-de.png]]

It's tempting to imagine a bi-polar Internet, with China on one side, and the
West on the other. In this model, it would be tempting to place, for example,
Bahrain on the China ``side.'' Germany might sit on the ``US side.'' Our metrics
reveal a much more complex picture. /In fact, all four countries mentioned here
have different profiles to one another/.

*The Internet is multi-polar, with different Internet governance decisions
producing diverse types of fragmentation.*
* Surprising divergences



For example, take China and the other Belt & Road countries. Per popular
imagination, China's model of the Internet has set a precedent, which is being
followed by its Belt and Road allies. Our data challenges that assumption.


[[./figures/china-vs-belt-and-road.png]]

In fact, China stands out in its data locality laws, its high degree of website
locality (perhaps as a result of censorship[fn:4]), its higher network
interference, and its propensity toward data laws. In fact, China's only
similarity with other Belt & Road countries are its low IPv6 penetration.

Alternatively, consider India and Bangladesh. These two regional neighbors have
substantially different profiles.

*Countires you would expect to be similar are sometimes quite different*. 

* Unexpected similarities

[[./figures/no-vs-islamic.png]]

If you asked me what Norway has in common with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, etc,
I'd have said ``aside from oil, not much.''

In reality, these countires have equivalent amounts of network interference,
similar content-layer locality, and similar IPv6 penetration. The main
difference that our profiles captures is simply that these Gulf states tend not
to have laws restricting the flow of data.

*Countries you would expect to be different can be surprisingly similar*.

* TODO So what?
** View 'internet fragmentation' in a more nuanced way, one that can guide guid policy
like US from 5-eyes
guide policy to get from A to B
** Guide policy smooth transitions between markets
* TODO Future work: Clusters of interoperability
<<future-work>>

# Comapring countries that are 'interoperable with one another'

are countries interoperable *with each other*?
for example, right now we look at how smilar content layer is to global,
 but what about argentina's content layer compared to chile's

this is
the /real/ ""clusters of internets" question

just calling them out may help them go away
*SO WHAT OF THIS*:
in any case, these clusters could become a key strategic planning tool
 for shifting between markets
 or for crafting policy


* TODO Reflections
** Just calling out clusters may help them go away---or make them more severe
briefly: what's the theory of change here?

** Am I convinced?

Currently, it's a little difficult to interpret these data outside of their
specific meeting. For example, to me, IPv6 is a more immediate proxy of a
country's "development" (another ambiguous term) than it is a proxy of
"fragmentation."

Of all of the metrics, website locality convinces me the most. It's a measure of
actual user behavior. I am sure network interference matters (and may matter
more if we split it down by interference type), but ultimately, the experience
of e.g., censorship may more acutely felt in the context of website locality (as
is the case with China).

In general, behavioral measures may appear more at the content layer. I'm not
sure that's a bad thing. The content layer shows us what people are, in
practice, doing. Yes, maybe laws that restrict data flows matter, but can we
observe that with actual behavior?

** TODO ``Locality'': What's in a name?

For many of our findings, *locality* makes more sense than /interoperability/ or /fragmentation/.

If we, in fact, want to look at ``interoperability'' (and I think we should),
then we should propose *that* as our next step---see [[future-work]].

# more like internet character profiles

# we also assume that index is going to be the one thing that sells
# maybe, maybe not... maybe these indices are also appropriate.
** TODO Future work
*** Expanding metrics per layer

In layer 4, we may be interested in DNS consistency as one measure of
Internet-level fragmentation. DNS consistency has a clear relationship to the
experience of browsing the Internet: what websites *can* you visit? It would be
worth researching possible sources for this data.

In general, in the future, it's worth thinking about how we would deal with
multiple metrics per layer. They don't fit neatly into our radar graph any more,
and we may have to do some averaging per-layer to compute a composite metric.
There's some art to this, I figure, and we should be mindful of that as we
expand horizontally within TCP/IP layers.
*** UI wishlist

It would also be great to view metrics in greater detail on rollover. We
certainly want our APIs to support that.
