# network-interference

This notebook calculates network interference in each country (per estimated number of internet users in that country).

## Requirements
- Python3
- Jupyter

### Python packages:

- Requests
- pandas
- numpy


# TODO

1. In the future, we could break down internet interference metrics by type (censorship, ISP throttling, etc).
2. Some countries may just have underreporting in the OONI dataset. For example, Libya,  Somalia---how many people are really running OONI tests?

## Minor:
1. Some of the countries OONI collects are not present in the WorldBank dataset about internet use.
