Code and data for the Internet Interoperability project.

You can view the [motivation behind this project, and the metrics we compute, here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w3cEedn49wXrF_PF072m-9NRyK0SiD-Ah-bI5cUt-9Q/edit?usp=sharing).

## Running the notebooks

Run a Jupyter notebook in the main repository directory.

```
cd III/
jupyter notebook

The notebook `analysis.ipynb` is computes comparative metrics and summary
statistics. The notebook `marshaling.ipynb` collates data from individual
metrics.

Each subfolder is responsible for computing particular metrics. Refer to each
folder's README for details.
