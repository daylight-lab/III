* Surprising divergences



*Countires you would expect to be similar are sometimes quite different*. 
Take China and its Belt & Road partners [fn:2]. Per popular
imagination, China's model of the Internet has set a precedent, one which other
Belt and Road countries follow.

[[./figures/china-vs-belt-and-road.png]]

Our data challenges that assumption. In fact, China stands out from other Belt &
Road countries. It has more data locality laws, a high degree of website
locality (perhaps as a result of censorship[fn:4]), and significantly higher
network interference. In fact, China's only similarity with other Belt & Road
countries are its low rates of IPv6 adoption.

Alternatively, consider India and Bangladesh. Despite similar culture, history,
and geographic locality, these two regional neighbors have substantially
different profiles.

* Unexpected similarities

*Countries you would expect to be different can be surprisingly similar*. If you
asked me what Norway has in common with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, etc, I'd have
said "aside from oil, not much."

In reality, these countires have similar amounts of network interference, a
similar degree of content-layer locality, and similar IPv6 penetration. The main
difference that our profiles captures is simply that these Gulf states tend not
to have laws restricting the flow of data.


* The Internet is not bi-polar

*The Internet is multi-polar, with different Internet governance decisions
producing diverse types of fragmentation.*
It's tempting to imagine a bi-polar Internet, with China on one side, and the
West on the other. In this model, it would be tempting to place, for example,
Bahrain on the China ``side.'' Germany might sit on the ``US side.'' Our metrics
reveal a much more complex picture. /In fact, all four countries mentioned here
have different profiles to one another/.

* So what?

Our profiles allow us to view 'internet fragmentation' in a more nuanced way.
Through this view, policymakers and advocates can describe how /specifically/
the internet differs across national borders.

*These specific metrics could help policymakers, advocacy organizations and
academics work toward specific, data-driven goals*. In doing so, they stand a
chance at de-fragmenting the Internet in a targeted way.

*Our data could provide industry stakeholders with a roadmap for moving from one
market to another*. For example, if a technology company is thinking of moving
from the United States to Southeast Asia, they could use our data to select
those countries with which the United States has a similar Internet.

** Future work: Clusters of interoperability
<<future-work>>

While our current work compares countries on a global scale,
future work could create point-to-point comparisons of countries,
producing *clusters of Internets
that are interoperable with one another*.

For example, on our content layer, we currently look at how similar popular
websites are to a global average. 
- But how similar is Argentina's list of most popular websites compared to Chile's? 
- How similar are the /types/ of network interference in Argentina vs Chile? 
- Both countries may have data laws, but do they have the /same/ or /similar/ data laws?


With this tool, policymakers could create more targeted interventions to, for
example "join the five-eyes Internet" or "move away from the Belt & Road
internet."

Those in industry could use these clusters as a key strategic planning tool,
allowing them to move products across Internets that, despite superficial
differences, are actually quite interoperable.
