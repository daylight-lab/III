* How we analyze our data

We produce a "radar" (or "spiderweb") plot. The radar plot describes a given
country's spread across the four metrics we currently measure. By visually
comparing these radar plots, we can establish rough "profiles" for
countries.

Here's an example. It compares the Scandinavian countries to one another. This
chart shows us that Norway has a higher rate of network interference than its
neighbors, while Sweden has a higher level of content-layer locality, and
Denmark has more legal-layer locality.

We can also average multiple countries' metrics together to create /blocks/.
Here's an example comparing Five Eyes countries[fn:3], Belt & Road countries, and
Islamic theocracies. Overall, Belt & Road countries have the same rate of
network interference, which is surprising. However, Belt & Road countries[fn:2]  have
higher content-layer locality, and more data
regulations. Interestingly, it is the Islamic theocracies[fn:1] who have the highest
incidence of network interference, though they, overall, have no laws regulating
data.
